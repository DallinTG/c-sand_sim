This is a sand sim or at least that's what i call 
it this was my first project in c++ i built 2 sand sims 
in JS before this but quickly ran into performance issues
so i decided to try C++. y a sand sim in the first place

PS

You can change these. W and H must just stay =
int world_width = 10;
int world_height = 10;
int chunck_width = 48;
int chunck_height = 48;
This is a bug and will not be fixed
